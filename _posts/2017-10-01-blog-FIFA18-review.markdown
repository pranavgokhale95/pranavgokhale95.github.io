# The review

FIFA 18, the yearly edition of the FIFA series is finally out. I have been an avid follower of the series from FIFA 09, and have played every year's version since then For years together, i wanted to buy a FIFA for myself, and finally I bought the Standard Edition along with EA early access. The early access gave me 10 hours of gameplay before the game was released on 29th September 2017. My game runs the Intel i5, 8GB of RAM and a 2GB Nvidia 830m GPU. The game works well on the Medium rendering settings and 2x MSXAA. This year, I have bought a great new controller. It's finally time to ditch the keyboard ;)

## Key takeaways from this year's edition: 

### Overall Gameplay 
* The presentation of the game is excellent. There seem to be quite a lot of changes in the stadium lighting and the atmosphere, bringing uniquesness to each league. The crowds are more lifelike. These small tweaks make the experience surreal. 
* The pitch looks more realistic than ever and it wears off as the game progresses
* I have observed that the overall gameplay seems to be slow than before. 

### Attack
* The game looks to be designed with attacking gameplay in mind. Every time you take the ball in the final third, high chances that you will end up challenging the keeper. 
* Crossing has definitely improved.
* You can shoot from distance and score some glorious goals more often than not. 
* The ground passing seems to be too accurate sometimes. EA had claimed that players who are off balance will not be able to pass the ball properly. That is definitely not the case though. 
* The players seem to make more behind the defence runs which makes through balls a key while attacking. 
* Pace is a key element to look out for while buying a player. The likes of Salah, Neymar, Ronaldo, Mane will make you pay for a mistake in the defence, or if your fullbacks are too far up the pitch. Counter attacks are damn real with such players.
* The matches I have played have been high scoring compared to FIFA 17 with professional level difficulty. 
* Penalties are far far better than the disastrous ones in FIFA 17. How often had you hit the ball with the power of a two year old! :’( Not the case now though. Certainly better.

### Defence
* On the other side, defending seems to be a lot difficult. Looks like EA has given more control of a player while off the ball, thus inviting mistakes while trying to commit a tackle. This opens up lots of spaces behind the defence leading to high scoring games. If you are playing it right, you will make a lot of interceptions with this ability. 
* The standing tackles have been rewritten. The sliding tackles take forever to respond. They are really bad, really really bad.  They have more animations than before. The type of standing tackle depends on how long you hold the tackle key now. Some of the animations are highly unrealistic and not even close to what happens on the pitch.
* I seemed to notice that the ball cleared from the corners tend to land up in different places rather than landing in the feet of opposition player positioned in the middle circle. So that's good. The controllers will survive. 
* Ball shielding is better. Shoulder tackles are legit. 

### Goalkeeping
* Expect the goalkeeper to make mistakes during corners and freekicks from distance. The keepers might fail to make any sort of contact while going for the ball. That is a really good addition to the game. 

### Game modes
* For players like me who prefer playing against AI more often, the squad battles in ultimate team are a welcome addition to the series.
* In the Manager mode, the transfer negotiations have gone a rewrite with optional cut scenes involving the player and both the managers. You can negotiate release clauses now. The transfers are no longer just a generic game of text and numbers. 
* I loved the Journey mode in FIFA 17. In this year’s edition, the journey is full of guest appearances from football stars (and basketball star/s too. Sorry for the spoiler :P).Will players play the Journey more than once?. Do the choices taken by Alex Hunter matter as the Journey progresses? It remains to be seen. I sincerely hope they do.

### Is improved than last year? 
Yeah. The magic of the frostbite engine has started to kick in with a lot of drama involved in the game than before. The gameplay is better than before but still a lot of room for improvement. 

### Should I buy it?
Yes. 

### My rating - 8/10
